--difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT
    In command line argument CMD completetly replaces the argument where as ENTRYPOINT appends the argument. 
    IF you specify both ENTRYPOINT and CMD in the dockerfile then, CMD will act as a defult argument, incase the argument is not passed during CLI it will pick the value from CMD.
--To modify the ENTRYPOINT during runtime
    Then mention the --entrypoint keyword in cli
docker run --entrypoint <new_command> <docker_image> <cmd_line_argument>
